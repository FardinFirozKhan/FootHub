            <h3>Barça want to force permanent Griezmann transfer to Atlético - Buy option triggered?</h3><br>
            <img class="nwsimg" src="images/ag.jpg" ><br><br>
            <p>Antoine Griezmann's transfer saga continues. The 31-year-old Frenchman, who scored Atlético Madrid's winner against Porto in the Champions League (2-1), could be subject to a lawsuit in Spain that is supposed to clear up the complicated loan contract that Barcelona and Atleti agreed on last summer.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>

            <table class="nwstbl">
                <tr>
                    <th><img class="nwsimgt" src="images/ag2.jpg"></th>
                    <th><h2>MARKET VALUE</h2></th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Antonnie Greizmann</td>
                    <td><h3>$35.00M</h3></td>
                </tr>
                <tr><td>Second-Striker</td></tr>
            </table>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p style="text-align: left;">Mundo Deportivo reported that Barcelona are preparing a lawsuit that is supposed to prove that the obligations buy option in Griezmann's loan contract has already been triggered and that the 31-year-old is now a permanent Atlético Madrid player. The background is a clause that would force Atleti to make the deal permanent for €40 million if he featured at least 45 minutes in 50% of the games he was available in.</p><br><br>
            <img class="nwsimg" src="images/ag1.jpg"><br><br>
            <p>This was certainly the case during the first season. Griezmann played 35 games for the Rojiblancos, in which he scored eight goals and seven assists. Because of those appearances, his loan was automatically extended by one more season and now opens the door for two different interpretations of the buy-option in his contract. </p>


            <p>While Barcelona are convinced that his appearances last season are enough to trigger the buy-option, Atlético believe that the 50% have to be spread over both seasons Griezmann is on loan at the club. As a result, Griezmann was brought off the bench in the first five games of the season, playing 28, 28, 26, 27, and 29 minutes. Head coach Diego Simeone did not want to confirm that his selection process was part of a club directive but also did not deny it. "I am a man of the club and always will be," Simeone said.</p>
