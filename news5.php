            <h3>Graham Potter joins Chelsea from Brighton - most expensive head coach ever?</h3><br>
            <img class="nwsimg" src="images/gp1.jpg" ><br><br>
            <p>Chelsea have confirmed the singing of Graham Potter as the club's new head coach, following the former Brighton manager agreeing a five-year deal with the club. According to the Times, the Stamford Bridge side have paid a fee worth a reported £20 million (€23m) to buy out Potter's contract with the Seagulls, which was set to run until 2025. This sum would make him the most expensive coach in the world, overtaking Bayern Munich’s Julian Nagelsmann.</p>

"I am very excited to partner with Chelsea’s new ownership group and look forward to meeting and working with the exciting group of players and to develop a team and culture that our amazing fans can be proud of. I would also like to place my sincere thanks to Brighton & Hove Albion for allowing me this opportunity and in particular Tony Bloom and all the players, staff and supporters for their continued support during my time at the club."</p><br><br>

            <p>Chelsea appoint Potter: “An innovator in the Premier League”
                Potter replaces Thomas Tuchel, who had been in charge for about 20 months. The new leadership now wants to move on with a new head coach. A press release said: "We are thrilled to bring Graham to Chelsea," said Chelsea chairman Todd Boehly. "He is a proven coach and an innovator in the Premier League who fits our vision for the Club. Not only is he extremely talented on the pitch, he has skills and capabilities that extend beyond the pitch which will make Chelsea a more successful Club. He has had a major impact at his previous Clubs’ and we look forward to his positive impact at Chelsea. We look forward to supporting him, his coaching team and the squad in realising their full potential in the coming months and years." </p>


            <p>In recent months, Tuchel worked closely together with new owner Boehly and oversaw an investment of €282 million in new players, the highest spending of any club in the world in the most recent summer transfer window.</p>
